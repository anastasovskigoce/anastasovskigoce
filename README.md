### Hey, it is Goce here 👋

I am an Engineering Manager at Alarm.com where I lead several teams working on video streaming. Over the years mastering Android has been my passion, but I have an appetite for learning new things in technology. I use my spare time working on tech talks; check out my [web site](https://ganastasovski.com/) for more details.
