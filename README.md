### Hey, it is Goce here ðŸ‘‹

I am an Android developer at Alarm.com where I lead a team of several mobile engineers focusing on video streaming. Over the years mastering Android has been my focus but I have an appetite for learning and I am curios by nature, thus, I am currently learning React and NodeJS. I am also an expiring conference speaker. Check out my [web site](https://ganastasovski.com/) for more details about me and my conference talks.
